# Raspberry Pi Pico - Operation

### Field Usage
- Plug Pico into battery package via Micro USB port, while holding down the button.
(This will power on the Pico in GPS tracking mode)
- Release your finger from the button shortly after the Pico's green indicator light turns on, as this indicates the Pico is now in operation mode.
- Carry on your path and the Pico will write coordinate and time data to its internal storage (We can store a little over 45,000 data points on the internal storage)
- Once you finish your route and want to stop tracking hold the button until the Pico's indicator light turns off

Your coordinate and time data is now stored on the Pico ready for parsing/upload.
